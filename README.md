# CI/CD Web Application using Docker on AWS

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline for a web application using Jenkins and Docker.
The application is automatically built, containerized, and deployed to an AWS EC2 instance.

## Tech Stack
- GitHub – Source code management
- Jenkins – CI/CD automation
- Docker – Containerization
- AWS EC2 – Deployment server
- Linux – Server environment
- Shell Scripting – Automation

## CI/CD Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. Jenkins pipeline is triggered automatically
3. Application is built and tested
4. Docker image is created
5. Docker image is deployed as a container on AWS EC2
6. Application becomes accessible via public IP

## Project Structure
